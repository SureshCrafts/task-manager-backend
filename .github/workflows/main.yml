    - name: Run Tests (Example)
      run: npm test # Replace with your project's test command (e.g., pytest, mvn test)

  # You can add more jobs here, e.g., 'deploy'
  # deploy:
  #   needs: build # This job will only run if the 'build' job succeeds

  #     - name: Deploy to Kubernetes (Example - requires Kubernetes tooling setup)
  #       run: |
  #         echo "Simulating deployment to Kubernetes..."
  #         # kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  #         # Here you would typically use actions like kubernetes-action/kubeconfig@v1 and kubernetes-action/kubectl@v1
